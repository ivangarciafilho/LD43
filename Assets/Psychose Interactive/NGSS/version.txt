Features and Changes (v2.2.5):
- Fixed a fade near distance bug in frustum shadows introduced in v2.2.4 (just import the package and you'll be good to go)

Features and Changes (v2.2.4):
- Added Frustum Shadows near distance property. Allows to skip and fade near-plane frustum shadows for users willing to display frustum shadows after a certain distance

Features and Changes (v2.2.3):
- Fixed an issue with frustum shadows blending with scene shadows
- Fixed a small frustum shadows clipping bug that slipped in v2.2.0
- Fixed the shadows displaying on top of a second camera (got re-introduced in v2.2.0)
- Re-added the screen space / world space ray scale toggle to frustum shadows

v2.2.2:
- Fixed a dark lighting bug if NGSS_FrustumShadows script is not present in the scene
- Added the ability to select how you want your ray length to be treated (world space or screen space)

v2.2.0:
- Frustum shadows (first iteration on Deferred only, supports all light types)
- Macro improvements to point shadows bias
- Removed Quality Settings global stuff on Directional component (only shadowmap size can be tweaked)
- Updated documentation about Local shadows component

V2.1.5:
- Blue noise shadows (the default shadows now). NGSS provides various blue noise textures but you can use any noise input with any pattern you want
- Minor tweaks to the Denoiser

V2.1.1:
- Early bailing out improvements, same shadows but faster to render
- New improved Denoiser, faster and better with exposed options to tweak
- Directional PCSS near & far distances behave better
- Local PCSS near & far distances exposed on Local light component
- Added spot & point shadows blocker search bias, also exposed on the light component
- Removed & Replaced unnecessary conditional branches on all shadows types making them slightly faster
- Fixed a bug with spot shadows that created weird artifacts when light range was too large
- Minor improvements to dithering algorithm for all lights
- Minor improvement to point light bias
- Updated documentation

V2.0.8:
- Improved self-shadowing bias for Contact Shadows (fixed silly artifacts at sharp angles)
- Deferred Backface Optimization. Skip fragments that are not facing the light (Improved performance a lot)
- Deferred Backface Translucency. Let you set how the backface is lit (0 = black, 1 = no backface shadows). Deferred Backface options requires deferred rendering and Gbuffer normals.
- Added compiler define for NGSS_Local shadows NGSS_GLOBAL_OPACITY (useful to avoid compile errors if you update/install Unity and your custom shaders have references to NGSS_GLOBAL_OPACITY)
- Updated documentation 

V2.0.7:
- Fixed a bug with NGSS_Directional component not updating shader global values if NGSS_NO_UPDATE_ON_PLAY was enabled

V2.0.6:
- Fixed two bugs with directional shadows in Forward when Cascaded Shadows where disabled.
One with shadows opacity and the other with the shadows softness not scaling well.

V2.0.5:
- Added coherent branching compiler defines (improves speed on some APIs/platforms)
- Macro speed improvements to PCF, skipping couple of unneeded instructions (all shadows)
- Ability to stop NGSS components from updating variables or receiving updates at runtime (if no needed)
- Disabling shadows on the light will stop NGSS component from update shadows variables
- Fixed a bug where new added local lights to the scene will override existing Global Settings
- Added support to OpenGLCore (PCF Local Shadows and PCSS/PCF Directional shadows)
- Added PCSS support to GLES3.0 (Directional shadows only, Local shadows still use PCF)
- Fixed a bug with Arkit shadowprojection
- NGSS libraries has now default minimal values (to avoid shadowed screen on install)
- Fixed a rare bug with Spot light shadows on Mac (Metal API)
- Removed OrderedDitheringDir array out of function (causes compilation error in PS4)
- Removed System.Security.AccessControl and its method block code (no needed)
- Cleaned up unneeded namespaces from NGSS components
- Fixed Contact shadows leaking on top of the main camera (can now be used on multiple cameras game setup). Renamed the light property into a more generic one, if you don't see ContactShadows make sure the light property is not null.
- NGSS internal libraries can now be added directly to shaders using the #include compiler directive. Useful if you can’t install the library locally, for example cloud builds (Refer to documentation)
- Update to documentation & new video tutorial added (to reflect new changes) 

V2.0.2:
- Initial public release
