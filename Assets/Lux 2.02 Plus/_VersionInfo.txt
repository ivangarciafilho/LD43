# Tessellation slightly reworked: Now you can specify the desired tessellation factor which gets clamped by the edge length limit.
# Global snow normals fixed for custom surface shaders.
# Fixed missing melting snow to water feature on simple terrain shader example.

KNOWN ISSUES
# Custom Surface Shaders: When using Global snow mapping and diffuse scattering, the normal which is used to calculate the scattering does not contain the snow normal. It will be replaced by a flat normal - which is better than using the wrong underlying normal.
