OFFLINE DOCUMENTATION!

THE BASICS OF THE TOOL:
EnviroSpawn is a tool that allows you to quickly populate large areas with objects.
It works on any surface, using raycasts.
Create an empty game object and go under Add Component > Enviro Spawn > EnviroSpawn.js.
then modify the variables to fit your needs.

HOW TO USE:
STEP 1: Under PREFABS select the amount of objects you want to be used and drag their prefabs.
STEP 2: Set DIMENSIONS to your preferred size.
STEP 3: Select LAYER MASK which will ignore all unwanted surfaces.
STEP 4: Select IGNORE MASK to avoid spawning on selected surfaces.
STEP 5: Set POPULATION (the amount of objects that you want to be generated inside the area).
STEP 6: Optional settings are OFFSET (which will determine the offset from the ground).
and FOLLOW NORMALS ORIENTATION (which will tell the objects to stay vertically or to follow the ground/normal orientation).
STEP 7: SCATTER MODE: Random/Fixed Grid/Even Spread - choose the way you want the prefabs to be positioned inside the chosen area.
-Fixed Grid: Instantiate the prefabs in a 1 unit * GridScale grid space. Starting from the bottom-left corner of the area and going left-to-right.
-Even Spread: Automatically calculating the grid intervals based on the dimensions and target population.

As of version 2018 the tool has been optimised to update only when it has been selected through the editor.
