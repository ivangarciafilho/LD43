Select HDR for camera.
Disable antialiasing in forward (MSAA - Unity Quality Settings) to not break HDR.
UBER is designed to work well in this mode.

Select linear lighting to get the right PBR look of attached example materials.

To get fog working in forward lighting open UBER/Shaders/UBER_ForwardFogType.cginc - select desired type and reimport shaders.
(any changes made to UBER_StandardConfig.cginc file also require reimporting shaders)
